This project tests different libraries to data treatment:

- MICE: To impute missing values. <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074241>documentation link </a>
- SMOTEEN: To oversampling data. <a href=http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html>documentation link</a>
- ReliefF: To select data. <a href=https://pypi.org/project/ReliefF>documentation link</a>

Was also made a method to evaluate different classifiers, including a voting ensemble.
